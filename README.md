# Introduction

Our project aims to build a comprehensive database management system for an online retail store specializing in electronics and related consumer goods. This system will focus exclusively on the online platform, excluding any physical store operations. The scope of the project includes the management of products, user profiles, procurement of electronic goods from suppliers, and inventory control. The database application will also assist in the administration of item distribution, which encompasses both orders placed by users and stock replenishment orders. By concentrating solely on the online platform, the implementation of the database system remains precise and manageable. The design separates back-end functions into distinct entities, such as inventory, distribution, and procurement, ensuring a modular architecture that enhances scalability and maintainability. The code provided implements key functionalities for customers and sellers, such as login and registration, product viewing and searching, cart management, order tracking, and profile management, aligning with the project's goals to create a robust and user-friendly online retail experience.
